### **Why Onix Scanner?**  
Performing multiple security scans manually can be time-consuming and inefficient. Without automation, running different security tools one by one for each engagement is a complex task. Onix Scanner simplifies this process by integrating multiple scanning tools, filtering out false positives, correlating results, and saving valuable timeâ€”all within a single tool.  

### **Features:**  
- **Easy Installation** â€“ One-step setup.  
- **Automated Multi-Tool Execution** â€“ Runs multiple security tools like `nmap`, `dnsrecon`, `wafw00f`, `uniscan`, `sslyze`, `fierce`, `theharvester`, `amass`, and `nikto` in a single command.  
- **Time Efficient** â€“ Reduces scanning time significantly.  
- **Enhanced Accuracy** â€“ Cross-checks vulnerabilities with multiple tools to minimize false positives.  
- **Lightweight & Efficient** â€“ Uses minimal system resources.  
- **User-Friendly Controls** â€“ Displays estimated scan time, allowing users to skip long-running tests.  
- **OWASP Top 10 & CWE 25 Integration** *(in progress)* â€“ Aligns findings with well-known security standards.  
- **Vulnerability Classification** â€“ Categorizes issues as Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Informational.  
- **Remediation Suggestions** â€“ Provides guidance on how to fix discovered vulnerabilities.  
- **Executive Summary** â€“ Generates a clear report summarizing key findings.  


### **Current Capabilities:**  
- Detects Load Balancers & Web Application Firewalls  
- CMS Detection (Joomla, WordPress, Drupal)  
- SSL Vulnerability Checks (Heartbleed, FREAK, POODLE, CCS Injection, Logjam, OCSP Stapling)  
- Open Ports & DNS Zone Transfer Analysis  
- Subdomain Enumeration (DNSMap, amass, nikto)  
- Brute-Force Testing for Open Directories & Files  
- Basic XSS, SQL Injection & Blind SQL Injection Detection  
- DoS Attacks (Slowloris), Local/Remote File Inclusion (LFI/RFI), and Remote Code Execution (RCE)  


### **Requirements:**  
- Python 3  
- Kali Linux (Preferred, as most tools are pre-installed)  
- Also tested on Parrot OS & Ubuntu  

### **Installation** ###
Alternatively, your can install the rapidscan python module with pip. This will create a link for rapidscan in your PATH.
